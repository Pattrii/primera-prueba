Accompanying code for the paper "Sub-Cluster AdaCos: Learning Representations for Anomalous Sound Detection" (http://wilkinghoff.com/publications/ijcnn21_sub-cluster.pdf).

You will need all datasets from task 2 "Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sounds for Machine Condition Monitoring" of DCASE 2020 (http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-unsupervised-detection-of-anomalous-sounds) as well as Tensorflow 2.

When finding this code helpful, or reusing parts of it, a citation would be appreciated:
